                This Week in Bitcoin: An End to 51% Attacks and Who Controls Bitcoin?.
              </ion-card-title>
            <p>
                This week we reported about a suggested solution to 51% attacks, a hacked exchange that was blamed for tanking the market and a cannabis-themed cryptocurrency bringing peace to the world. We also learned, in this week’s most commented-on article, 
                who really controls Bitcoin and why it won’t become a global currency,
                according to the CEO of Ripple.
